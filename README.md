# Heuristic Optimization Algorithms

Final Project for the course **AI2101 - Convex Optimization** under Prof. Aditya Siripuram

> **Report.pdf** contains the report for our project

In a list of different project topics given, one amongst them is Heuristic Optimization Algorithms.

In convex optimization, we have methods to find the exact minima because the problem can be proved to be convex. <br>
However, when it is non-convex, we use heuristics to find a near-optimal solution. 

The project was to study three different heuristics.

### Abstract
Abstractâ€”This paper covers three heuristic algorithms in optimization, consisting of the Travelling Salesman Problem using a heuristic approach (Simulated Annealing), Tabu-Search heuristic and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic for the Knapsack Problem.
