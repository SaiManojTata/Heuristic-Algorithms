In a list of different project topics given, one amongst them is Heuristic Optimization Algorithms.
Given a non-convex problem, try solving the problems with near approximation using Heuristic Methods.

Task was to work on any three such heuristic algorithmic problems.

### Abstract
Abstractâ€”This paper covers three heuristic algorithms in optimization, consisting of the Travelling Salesman Problem using a heuristic approach (Simulated Annealing), Tabu-Search heuristic and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic for the Knapsack Problem.
