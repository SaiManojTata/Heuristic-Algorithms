# Heuristic Optimization Algorithms

AI2101 - Convex Optimization, course work project for grades evaluation (Group Project)

In a list of different project topics given, one amongst them is Heuristic Optimization Algorithms.
Given a non-convex problem, try solving the problems with near approximation using Heuristic Methods.

Task was to work on any three such heuristic algorithmic problems.
